Description: Program to encrypt a user provided plaintext file with a 16 character user provided key using a simplified version of AES.
While encrypting the plain text, the program writes the output following each step of encryption to both the screen and a user specified
output file including the final ciphertext produced by the encryption process.

To compile on UNT CELL machines:
    g++ SimplifiedAESEncryption.cpp

To run:
    ./a.out
    Provide input and output file names when prompted by program
